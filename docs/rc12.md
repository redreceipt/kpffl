# R.C.012: COVID Lineup Contingencies

## Why Is It Important?
Because of the unprecedented number of games threatened to be canceled or rescheduled due to COVID-19.

## What is Different?
Nothing besides managers are allowed to set lineup contingencies to avoid not playing their optimal lineup because they are worried that games may be canceled. This is different from game time injury decisions because in those scenarios you have the ability and responsibility to make a last minute sub. These “COVID games” are sometimes being rescheduled to Tuesday nights or other weeks entirely. This is entire teams we are talking about, not individual players.

## How Does It Work?
It is up to each person to nominate their backup player (or list) for as many positions as they would like. As long as a player is nominated prior to the nominated players kickoff time the LM will retroactively edit the lineups/scores as necessarily in the event of later cancellations. The LMs can message each other their contingency lineups. This is just insurance in the event that a player in your lineup has their game canceled without having the opportunity to replace them because your other players have already locked. It is not akin to best ball formatting.
